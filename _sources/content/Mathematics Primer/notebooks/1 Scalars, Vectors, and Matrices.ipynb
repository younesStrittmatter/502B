    "\n",
    "A *scalar* is a number used to quantify magnitude (e.g. temperature), while a *vector* is a number used to quantify magnitude and direction (e.g. wind).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Vectors are typically formatted as a list of numbers with each number corresponding to one direction. Familiar Cartesian coordinates have 2 dimensions, X & Y, and a vector in Cartesian coordinates is 1x2, a one dimensional list with two numbers. \n",
    "For example, west-east is the X axis and south-north is the Y axis. The vector (3, 4) indicates wind moving both 3 mph west and 4 mph north, but the combination of these components is a vector of wind moving 5 mph northwest (thanks to the pythagorean theorem, $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$). The magnitude is the distance from the origin (0,0), in this case 5. The vector itself is one dimensional and can be depicted as an arrow starting at (0,0) and extending to (3,4) in these Cartesian coordinates.    \n",
    "\n",
    "***Note:*** A number with magnitude AND two or more directions is called a *tensor*. One way to think of a basic tensor is pinching and pulling a rubber sheet toward you: there is a magnitude of force pulling back toward the initial position (you could use this to launch a pebble like a slingshot) and there is also a magnitude of tension in the rubber sheet itself that will contract back when you let go. Tensors are used to describe gravity in general relativity.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Vectors are typically formatted as one-dimensional data structures or lists, 1xN, with N as the length of the list.  A *matrix* is a two-dimensional, MxN, data structures. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we introduce common mathematical notation and the equivalent code implementation in [Numpy](https://numpy.org/).\n",

    "### Notation\n",
    "  \n",
    "Like scalars, vectors and matrices of numbers can be added and multiplied. However, these operations differ from their scalar counterparts, and are heavily dependent on dimensionality. Matrix and vector dimensions are given as (r x c) where r is the number of rows, and c is the number of columns. Individual vectors are 1 dimensional and notated as a single row (1 x c) or as a single column (r x 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, $a$ is a [1x3] vector, called a row vector. Vector $b$ is a [3x1] vector, called a column vector. $C$ is a [3x3] matrix. The components of a matrix $C$ are denoted $c_{ij}$, where i is the row index and j is the column index.\n",
