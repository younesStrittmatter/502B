# A Guide to Computational Modeling with [PsyNeuLink](https://princetonuniversity.github.io/PsyNeuLink/) in Cognitive Neuroscience

This guide introduces a variety of computational techniques and concepts used in modern cognitive neuroscience using [PsyNeuLink](https://princetonuniversity.github.io/PsyNeuLink/).

## Prerequisites

This guide introduces [PsyNeuLink](https://princetonuniversity.github.io/PsyNeuLink/), a Python package for building cognitive and neural models. It is assumed that you have some familiarity with Python and Numpy, and are comfortable with basic programming concepts. You should also complete the [PsyNeuLink Beginner Tutorial](https://princetonuniversity.github.io/PsyNeuLink/index_logo_with_text.html#tutorial) prior to this course, unless you are already familiar with the PsyNeuLink environment.
