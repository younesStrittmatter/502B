# From Molecules to Systems to Behavior

This guide introduces a variety of experimental and computational techniques and concepts used in modern cognitive neuroscience. Topics include functional magnetic resonance imaging, scalp electrophysiological recording, and computational modeling. In-lab lectures provide students with the background necessary to understand the scientific content of the labs, but the emphasis is on the labs themselves, including student-designed experiments using these techniques. This is the second term of a double-credit core lab course required of all Neuroscience Ph.D. students.

## Prerequisites

This course introduces [PsyNeuLink](https://princetonuniversity.github.io/PsyNeuLink/), a Python package for building cognitive and neural models. It is assumed that you have some familiarity with Python and Numpy, and are comfortable with basic programming concepts. You should also complete the [PsyNeuLink Beginner Tutorial](https://princetonuniversity.github.io/PsyNeuLink/index_logo_with_text.html#tutorial) prior to this course, unless you are already familiar with the PsyNeuLink environment.
