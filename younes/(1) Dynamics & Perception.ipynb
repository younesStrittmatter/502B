    "\n",
    "**Note:** You should complete the [PsyNeuLink Beginner Tutorial](https://princetonuniversity.github.io/PsyNeuLink/index_logo_with_text.html#tutorial) prior to starting Lab 1, unless you are already familiar with the PsyNeuLink environment.\n",

    "## Overview\n",
    " \n",
    "In this lab we will explore dynamic models using some examples from Perception. We'll start with a Hopfield Network ([Hopfield, 1982](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.79.8.2554)) that takes noisy input and settles on a stable interpretation, then we'll explore some simple examples of dynamic networks evolving over time, and finally consider bistable percepts that can be interpreted multiple ways.  Along the way we'll cover numerous examples and concepts that recur and are useful throughout this course.\n",

    "### Noisy Input and Perception: Hopfield Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are looking out at the world through a rainstorm, your sense data are noisy with a messy distribution of water droplets partially obscuring your view at any given moment, but you are typically still able to recognize the landscape.  Similarly, if you are walking through a forest on a sunny windy day the pattern of sunlight dancing on the forest floor makes your raw sense data fluctuate unpredictably, but you can still reliably recognize the path, plants, stones, etc.  Sense data are often noisy, and Hopfield Networks can model how to reliably extract signal from and input of signal mixed with noise using associative nodes and thresholds.\n",

    "Next, we'll implement how a Hopfield network can memorize patterns and recognize them when presented with noisy versions of those patterns. First, we'll set up the connections between units in our network, represented by a 25-by-25 weight matrix initialized with zeros. Each unit is connected to every other unit, and we'll manually set the diagonal of the weight matrix to zero to ensure that each unit isn't connected to itself. Each unit corresponds to a \"pixel\" in the input letter patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "To \"train\" the network, we supply each input pattern to the network and update the weights. Mathematically, this involves computing the outer product of each pattern (where patterns are represented using 1s and -1s) and adding it to the existing weights. This process effectively constructs a covariance matrix. The result is that when two units are coactivated in a pattern, the strength of their connection increasesâ€”an example of Hebbian learning (Hebb, 1949), which states that \"neurons that fire together, wire together.\""
