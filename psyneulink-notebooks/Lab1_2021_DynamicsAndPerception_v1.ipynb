    " \n",
    "In this lab we will explore dynamic models using some examples from Perception.  We'll start with a Hopfield Network that takes noisy input and settles on a stable interpretation, then we'll explore some simple examples of dynamic networks evolving over time, and finally consider bistable percepts that can be interpretted multiple ways.  Along the way we'll cover numerous examples and concepts that recur and are useful throughout this course.     \n",

    "# Noisy Input and Perception: Hopfield Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are looking out at the world through a rainstorm, your sense data are noisy with a messy distribution of water droplets partially obscuring your view at any given moment, but you are typically still able to recognize the landscape.  Similarly, if you are walking through a forest on a sunny windy day the pattern of sunlight dancing on the forest floor makes your raw sense data fluctuate unpredictably, but you can still reliably recognize the path, plants, stones, etc.  Sense data are often noisy, and Hopfield Networks can model how to reliably extract signal from and input of signal mixed with noise using associative nodes and thresholds.  \n",

    "## Necker Cube Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The Necker Cube is a 2D drawing with two common 3D interpretations: the faces of the cube that you see in the \"front\" and \"back\" can be reversed -- this also corresponds to seeing the 3D cube from \"above\" or \"below.\"  With a little practice most people can alternate between seeing these two interpretations.  However, almost nobody looks at the figure and spontaneously sees a tangled 3D object with vertices at arbitrary depths, or a 3D \"X\" or any one of a vast number of other possibilities.  How you interpret the vertices seems to be a holistic (Gestalt) process where the local positions of vertices and 3D angles are fixed by a more global interpretation.  Could a network of merely local connections give rise to two distinct globally stable interpretations?  Put another way, could vertices represented with weights connecting only to a few local neighboring vertices spontaneously move toward either of two global attractor states corresponding to the two interpretations we actually see?  This question motivates the next models we will explore.  \n",

    "You can get a sense from these two figures how we might label and organize a Necker cube model [Note: FUL stands for Front Upper Left, and the other abbreviations are similar.]  Take a few moments to infer as much as you can from the two figures. \n",

    "\n",
    "Remember that we are aiming to create this emergent order of clustering and mutual inhibition out of only local connections.  In the following cell we will create a matrix specifying the connection weights.  Look down at the second line: Build_N_Matrix[0,:] = [0, 1, 3, 4, 8].  You can think of the numbers [0, 1, 3, 4, 8] like this: the first number [0] is a vertex (more specifically, it is a particular 3D interpretation of the spatial position of that vertex), the next three numbers [1, 3, 4] are vertex interpretations that will have excitatory connections to [0], and the last number [8] will have an inhibitory connection to [0].  Now look back at the figure above to fully understand this schematic.  In the left cube 0 is connected by an edge to three other vertices [1, 3, 4].  In the right cube, vertex 8 is in the same position as 0 but has the opposite depth interpretation: 0 and 8 are mutually exclusive interpretations, and their activations should be inversely related using mutual inhibition.

This function could be useful if you have a competition and want to highlight the winner, giving it extra weight for a subsequent computation.  The way softmax works is by first treating each number as an exponent.  Assume we start with the numbers [2, 3, 4]. If our base is 2 [the actual softmax function uses the natural logarithm e as its base rather than 2 -- but base 2 is easier for me to double check the math in my head as I go.], then the first step changes the numbers to [2^2, 2^3, 2^4] or [4, 8, 16].  While 2 and 4 started out close together, the difference between 4 and 16 is much larger.  The next step is to add all the numbers together (4+8+16) = 28.  Then we divide all the numbers by the total of 28; [4/28, 9/28 16/28].  Now the sum of all the numbers in our collection is 1, and their relative magnitudes have been exagerated.  Having all the numbers sum to 1 might also be useful if we want to treat them as probabilities. \n",

    "The idea of bistable perception is fascinating, and it made me wonder about other examples.  A Google search brought me to a dynamic example called the **\"Spinning Dancer\"** that can be seen as spinning either clockwise or counterclockwise.  Strangely, this bistable figure is difficult to intentionally see as the opposite interpretation from whatever you saw first.  I got stuck on clockwise and my roommate got stuck on counterclockwise.  I wonder why this is?  Maybe it has to do with fatigue.  It might be harder to fatigue neurons looking at motion.  It would be interesting to design some experiments or come up with a model that could explain what is happening with the spinning dancer and why it is different than the Necker Cube and Duck-Rabbit.       \n",

    "While I was trying to get the first duck/rabbit model to work I realized I didn't really understand a bunch of the code, so I starting reading more about **numpy** functions and the **PsyNeuLink documentation**.  Here are some concepts I learned about that I think might be helpful later in the course (all the following concepts are defined in my own words, not copied/pasted)... \n",

    "# How to Format & Submit Homework\n",
    "\n",
    "Your homework should be completed in a new Jupyter notebook that you create on the server (File -> New Notebook -> Python 3) or Google Colab.  Be sure to include the import packages cells for numpy and PsyNeuLink.  Name the notebook with your last name and the assignment: LastName_Lab1_homework.ipynb.  It must be formatted clearly, like the lab notebooks, with text primarily in Markdown cells using headings and subheadings, and code primarily in code cells.  After you have completed everything, save the notebook, then select Kernel -> Restart & Run All.  Double check that your code cells have all executed and produced the intended outputs.  Then choose File -> Print Preview.  This will create a new version of your Jupyter notebook as a static web page formatted in html.  Save this page as a pdf:  Use a Google search \"how to convert a webpage from [browser] to pdf\" [replace \"browser\" with Chrome, Explorer, Safari, Firefox or whatever browser you use, and follow the instructions you find].  Finally, name this document LastName_Lab1_homework.pdf and submit the pdf on Blackboard.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Please note the importance of formatting your homework to appear clear, well-labeled and easy to read.  Make judgment calls about how much output is too much to include (e.g. don't include output longer than 1 page from a single executed cell).  There are ways to adjust the code to only display what is necessary.  Use headings to highlight the different questions.  Use the internet to help you, e.g. Google search: How to get italics in Markdown.  \n",

    "Each assignment is graded out of 10 points.  \n",
    "**3 Completeness**: Did you answer all the questions thoughtfully?  If you are unable to arrive at a satisfactory answer, you should still include all your attempts with annotation explaining what you did and what problems you encountered.   \n",
    "**3 Clarity**: Your homework should be well organized and easy to read.  Use the Markdown formatting options for headings and subheadings.  It is important to communicate effectively.         \n",
    "**3 Creativity**: BUILD section.  Problem solving in real life is typically open-ended and the solutions are not known by anyone in advance (otherwise you would just look them up.)  We want you to creatively engage with the course material, apply the concepts you learn to new topics, and to build your own new models.      \n",
    "**1 Collaboration**: You must attend lab and participate.  Your homework should include acknowledgments indicating who you collaborated with on the assignment.   \n",

    "You are strongly encouraged to collaborate with classmates on the homework assignments, and you are allowed to share code as you collaborate.  However, you should never submit code that you do not understand.  If a classmate, tutor, or lab instructor helps you with writing code, it is up to you to understand and annotate that code (using #comments or Markdown cells) in your own words explaining how the code works. Note that you receive credit for good annotations as part of the open-ended BUILD component of each lab.  \n",
