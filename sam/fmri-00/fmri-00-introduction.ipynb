    "### Part 2: Coordinate space(s)\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the course of fMRI processing, the functional data are often spatially transformed into another \"space\"â€”typically a standard space. We'll need to keep the following distinctions in mind during analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "* native space vs. standard space\n",
    "* volume space vs. surface space\n",
    "* standard space and templates, e.g. MNI152, MNI305, fsaverage\n",
    "* voxel space vs. world space\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Native space vs. standard space\n",
    "The first distinction is between native and standard space. Native space refers to the subject-specific configuration under which the data were collected. Analyzing data in native space requires the minimal amount of data manipulation (e.g. aligning and resampling), but the lack of voxelwise correspondence across subjects prevents some types of group analysis. To achieve voxelwise correspondence across subjects, we typically perform spatial normalization to align each subject's data to a template image (e.g. *MNI152NLin2009cAsym*) in a standard space (e.g. *MNI space*). There are several standard spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Volume space vs. surface space\n",
    "The second distinction is between volume- and surface-based analysis. MRI data are collected in a volumetric format where each data point corresponds to a voxel at a particular location in a three-dimensional grid; volumetric analysis retains this three-dimensional grid representation of the data. In contrast, surface-based analysis is argued to better capture the sheet-like structure of the cortical mantle. In surace-based analysis, the functional data are resampled onto two-dimensional graph-like triangular mesh where each data point corresponds to a vertex at a particular location in the mesh. Importantly, two voxels on either side of a sulcus may appear to be close according to their Euclidean distance in volume space, whereas surface space more accurately that they are farther apart in terms of geodesic distance on the folded cortical surface. The *fsaverage* template is typically used for spatial normalization of surface-based data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Standard space and templates\n",
    "The third distinction is between a standard space and the specific *template* in that space. A template is an actual brain image (typically the average of many subjects) that serves as a target for alignment. Although \"MNI space\" is very widely used, there are in fact many specific *templates* in MNI space that each differ in small ways (read more [about the MNI space(s)](https://www.lead-dbs.org/about-the-mni-spaces/) at Lead-DBS).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Voxel space vs. world space\n",
    "The fourth distinction is between voxel space and world space. A standard space (e.g. MNI space) is defined in real-world coordinates. However, any given brain image is rendered in a voxel space (or \"image space\") with a particular geometry and grid: i.e. voxel size, field of view, etc. The translation between the voxel space of a given brain image and real-world coordinates are stored in an matrix accompanying the data (called an *affine matrix*). When we align a brain image to a standard space, we align it in real-world coordinates, but then we resample (or slice it) onto a particular grid of voxels. Different brain images with different geometries (voxel size, field of view, etc) can all be *in* (i.e. *aligned to*) MNI space."

We want to extract some subset of voxels based on a particular \"mask\"â€”for example, the entire brain (excluding everything outside the brain), only gray matter (excluding white matter, CSF, etc), or a particular region of interest (ROI; e.g. ventral temporal cortex). As long as our data and mask are in the same space and on the same grid, we can mask our data using simple NumPy indexing. Here, we demonstrate masking with the brainmask and with an anatomical atlas. Load in `brainmask.nii.gz` and extract the NumPy array. Inspect the shape of the mask, the unique values in the mask, and then visualize a slice (e.g. slice `50` in the first dimension) of the mask."
